# Interview Fundamentals

> Master the core principles that make or break interviews

## 🎯 Essential Tips

### 🔹 Tip 1: Structure > Speed
Don't rush into answering. Take 3–5 seconds to pause, think, and outline your thoughts. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral questions.

**Why it works:** Shows you can organize thoughts under pressure and gives structured, easy-to-follow answers.

### 🔹 Tip 2: Show Business Impact
Don't just say what you did. Say *why it mattered*.

| ❌ Weak | ✅ Strong |
|---------|-----------|
| "Built dashboard" | "Built a dashboard that helped cut support time by 30%" |

**Why it works:** Employers care about business results, not just technical tasks.

### 🔹 Tip 3: Clarify Before Coding (Technical Rounds)
Always ask:
- "What edge cases should I handle?"
- "Do you want me to optimize for time or readability?"

**Why it works:** This shows *collaborative thinking*, not just coding skills.

### 🔹 Tip 4: Speak Like a Builder, Not Just a Doer
Highlight ownership:
- ✅ "I led…"
- ❌ "I was told to…"

**Why it works:** Startups especially value people who take initiative and think beyond the ticket.

### 🔹 Tip 5: Prepare Stories, Not Scripts
Memorized answers sound fake. Instead, prepare 5–6 real stories that show:
- Resilience
- Leadership
- Conflict resolution
- Metrics-driven results

Then mix & match as needed.

**Why it works:** Authentic stories are more memorable and adaptable to different questions.

### 🔹 Tip 6: Ask Sharp Questions at the End
Don't say "No questions." Instead ask:
- "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
- "What traits make someone thrive here?"
- "What's the biggest challenge your team is tackling now?"

**Why it works:** Shows genuine interest and helps you evaluate if the role is right for you.
