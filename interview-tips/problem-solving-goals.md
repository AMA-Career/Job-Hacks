# Problem-Solving & Goals

> Master frameworks for tackling challenges and discussing career growth

## ðŸ§  Problem-Solving Framework

### "Describe your process for solving problems"

**What they're testing:**
- Can you handle challenges independently?
- Do you follow a clear, repeatable method?

**How to answer:**
- Start with a common problem you've faced in your role
- Walk through your process step-by-step (e.g. identify â†’ analyze â†’ decide â†’ execute â†’ reflect)
- Highlight adaptability, logic, and results

**âœ… Tip:** Don't just focus on the outcomeâ€”show how you *thought* through it

### Sample Framework Structure
1. **Identify** - Recognize and define the problem clearly
2. **Analyze** - Gather information, understand root causes
3. **Decide** - Evaluate options and choose best approach
4. **Execute** - Implement solution with clear steps
5. **Reflect** - Review results and lessons learned

## ðŸŽ¯ Career Goals Framework

### "Share an example of a career goal you had"

**What they're testing:**
- Are you self-driven?
- Do you know how to plan, commit, and follow through?

**How to answer:**
- Pick a goal that's relevant to the role (e.g. getting promoted, learning a new skill, switching functions)
- Explain *why* it mattered to you
- Outline what you did to achieve it (planning, obstacles, actions taken)
- End with the result and what you learned

**âœ… Tip:** Choose a goal that shows long-term thinking and initiative

## ðŸ›  Implementation Guide

### Problem-Solving Example Structure
```
"When I encounter a problem, I follow a structured approach:

1. First, I clearly define what's happening and why it's a problem
2. Then I gather data and talk to stakeholders to understand root causes
3. I brainstorm multiple solutions and evaluate pros/cons of each
4. I implement the chosen solution with clear milestones
5. Finally, I review what worked and what I'd do differently next time

For example, [specific story using STAR method]..."
```

### Career Goals Example Structure
```
"One career goal I set was [specific goal]. This mattered to me because [personal motivation]. 

To achieve it, I:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2] 
- [How I overcame obstacles]

The result was [quantified outcome], and I learned [key lesson that applies to this role]."
```
