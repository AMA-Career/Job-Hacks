# Q&A Strategy

> Turn question sessions into selling opportunities and communicate effectively

## üéØ Strategic Q&A Approach

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use the Q&A Session to Sell Yourself Again

**Don't just ask questions!** Use it as a chance to reinforce your strengths.

**Try saying:**
"I know this is a very competitive position. I'd love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."

**Based on their response:** Briefly highlight how you align with those qualities.

**Also ask about next steps** to show your strong interest in the role.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make Your Experience Audience-Friendly

**The problem:** Most HR don't have a technical background, so it's important to explain your work in clear, simple terms.

**The solution:** Try writing out your example and using ChatGPT to help rephrase it for a non-technical audience.
