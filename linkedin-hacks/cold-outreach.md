# Cold Outreach

> Build your own outreach system and get recruiters to message you first

## üî• Core Strategies

### 1. Cold Email, But Smarter

**The system:**
- Some recruiters list their email directly on LinkedIn
- Create your own cheatsheet by collecting these manually
- Craft short, polite cold emails showing you did your homework
- **Bonus tip:** Mention why you're *specifically* interested in their company

**Why this works:** Direct email bypasses LinkedIn's messaging limitations and shows initiative.

### 2. Let Recruiters Come to *You*

**The strategy:**
- Follow recruiters and hiring managers in your target industry
- Watch their posts, many share roles before HR does
- When they ask for BGs or emails in comments, drop yours early
- If you're a match, you might get that magical "Are you free to chat?" DM

**Why this works:** You're engaging with them when they're actively looking, not cold pitching.
