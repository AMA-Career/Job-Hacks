# Fresh Job Discovery

> Find jobs before the crowd discovers them

## üöÄ LinkedIn URL Hack

### Find Jobs Posted in Last 1-2 Hours

**Step-by-step:**
1. Search for your target job on LinkedIn
2. Filter by "Past 24 hours"
3. In the URL, change `f_TPR=r86400` to:
   - `r3600` for the past 1 hour
   - `r7200` for the past 2 hours

**Why this works:** You'll see super fresh job posts before they get flooded with applications.

**Pro tip:** Check multiple times throughout the day, especially morning and late afternoon when HR teams typically post new roles.

## üíº Skill Endorsement Strategy

### Get More Eyes on Your Profile

**The hack:**
1. Recruiters often search keywords like "Python" or "SQL"
2. LinkedIn ranks profiles higher if your skills are endorsed
3. Choose 5‚Äì10 relevant skills, add them to your profile
4. Ask friends to endorse you‚Äîmakes a BIG difference!

**Why this works:** Endorsed skills boost your visibility in recruiter searches, leading to more profile views and potential outreach.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Audit your skills section** - Remove irrelevant skills, keep only job-relevant ones
2. **Prioritize technical skills** - These are most searched by recruiters
3. **Ask strategically** - Reach out to colleagues who actually know your skills
4. **Reciprocate** - Endorse others who endorse you

## üéØ Hidden Job Discovery

### Find Jobs Not on Official Job Boards

**Search format on LinkedIn posts tab:**
```
[Role] + [Location] + Hiring / Looking / Opening / Recruiting
```

**Examples:**
- "Product Designer San Francisco Hiring"
- "Software Engineer Remote Looking"
- "Data Analyst NYC Opening"

**Filter by:** Past 24 hours

**Why this works:** These are often real-time team posts *before* they hit job boards. You'll find opportunities with much less competition.

### Advanced Search Tips
- Try variations: "We're hiring", "Join our team", "Looking for", "Seeking"
- Include company names: "Google hiring software engineer"
- Use location variations: "Bay Area", "SF", "San Francisco"
- Search in different languages for international opportunities

## ‚è∞ Timing Strategy

### Best Times to Search
- **Morning (8-10 AM):** HR teams often post new roles
- **Late afternoon (3-5 PM):** Second wave of daily postings
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Highest posting volume
- **Avoid:** Friday afternoons and weekends (lowest activity)

### Frequency Recommendations
- **Fresh URL searches:** 2-3 times daily
- **Hidden job searches:** Once daily
- **Profile optimization:** Weekly skill updates
- **Endorsement requests:** 2-3 per week max

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these to measure your job discovery effectiveness:
- Number of fresh jobs found per day
- Profile views increase after endorsements
- Jobs applied to within first 24 hours of posting
- Response rate on early applications vs. late applications
