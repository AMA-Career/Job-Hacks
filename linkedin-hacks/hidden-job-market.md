# Hidden Job Market

> Access jobs before they hit official job boards

## üî• Discovery Strategies

### 1. Find Hidden Jobs Before They Go Viral

```
[Role] + [Location] + Hiring / Looking / Opening / Recruiting
```

**Examples:**
- "Product Designer San Francisco Hiring"
- "Software Engineer Remote Looking"
- "Data Analyst NYC Opening"

**Then filter by:** Past 24 hours

**Why this works:** These are often real-time team posts *before* they hit job boards, giving you access to opportunities with much less competition.

### 2. Get Recruiters to Reach Out First

**The strategy:**
- Follow recruiters and team leads in your target companies
- They often post openings *before* HR uploads the official JD
- Many ask for you to drop your background or email in the comments
- If you're a fit, they'll DM you *directly* for interviews

**Why this works:** You're connecting with decision-makers before the role gets hundreds of applications.
